I finally decided to make my website. I will be updating this blog with things that I've learned throughout different projects I work on. Hopefully these will be both my personal projects along with the different projects and assignments I have in my future clases. My hope is to help others along in their own journey to learn programming in any way I can. If any of these future blog posts help you please feel free to share the information and my site with anyone you think it may help.
